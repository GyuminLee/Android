This project requires:
Android SDK
Android NDK
liblame

This project does not contain the shared libraries for LAME.

In order to build them, you must first install the Android NDK from:
http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html
Installing the Android NDK is beyond the scope of this INSTALL file.

LAME shared libraries are contained in the liblame project, available at my
github here: http://github.com/intervigilium/liblame

This project will need to set up liblame as a referenced library project.
For more information on how to do this, please consult the Android
documentation and developer resources.

To build the libraries you must go to /path/to/liblame and issue the command:
/path/to/ndk-build 

The NDK builder will compile the shared libraries and place them in the 
liblame/libs directory where the builder for Lame4Android can find them
and include them in the final apk.
