The authors of some of the original algorithms were Juan Pablo Bello (multi
comb pitch detection and onsets), Chris Duxbury (onsets), Samer Abdallah (peak
picking), Alain de Cheveigne (pitchyin).  Details to the relevant articles are
provided in each file.

The midi files have been borrowed from Fluidsynth, written by Peter Hanappe.

Also many thanks to Miguel Ramirez and Nicolas Wack for their bug fixing.
