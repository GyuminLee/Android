StaggeredGridView
=======

## Introduction

This is a demo of StaggeredGridView. The StaggeredGridView allows the user to create a GridView with uneven rows similar to how Pinterest looks. Includes own OnItemClickListener and OnItemLongClickListener, selector, and fixed position restore.

## Setup

You must clone StaggeredGridView along with StaggeredGridViewDemo and import both projects into your workspace. If they are in the same parent directory everything should work fine. Otherwise you must define StaggeredGridView as a library for StaggeredGridViewDemo
